## Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial industry. This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training the model is the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which contains anonymized features of credit card transactions.

## Features

- Fraud detection model using various classification algorithms.
- Preprocessing techniques to handle imbalanced datasets.
- Model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Flask API to serve the model for real-time predictions.
